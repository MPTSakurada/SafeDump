# SafeDump
This recursively toggles all EBOOTs and VPKs in a folder from unsafe mode to safe mode.
Drag and drop the folder containing maidumps/vpks on top of SafeDump's executable binary.
It will toggle all unsafe eboots found, either loose (maidump) or packed (vpk), it will also take care of eboot_origin, of zips and of zipped VPKs.

This is not my code, the author didn't want to be in the spotlight so I have published it.

I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY IF SOMETHING YOU SAFE MODED WITH THIS STILL BRICKS YOUR VITA. You run anything on your vita at your own risk, use your own judgement.
